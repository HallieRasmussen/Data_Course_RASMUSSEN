2. I love biology and one of my favorite animals are wolves. I found a dataset that compares tooth fractures in wolves and availability of prey. I think it would be interesting to analyze this data. Instead of comparing tooth fractures to prey availability I am going to compare more of the data relating to age, sex, and broken teeth. 

3. The dataset I found has a bunch of different wolves, their age, sex, and a lot of information about their teeth (including how many they have, how many are broken, and how many of each type of tooth they have). I found this dataset in a google dataset search. The source of this data is a website called zenodo. The data has a lot of different numbers, has sexes, and ID numbers. It also has some data on elk bones that had been chewed/eaten by wolves and were found.
